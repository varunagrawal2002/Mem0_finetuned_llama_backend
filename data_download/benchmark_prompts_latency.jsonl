Ms. Star looked all around space for the right gift for Moon. She asked Saturn was she was going to get Moon. \"Oh, I think I'm going to get Moon a space puppy. He was talking about how much he loved dogs!\" That sounded like such a good idea to Ms. Star, but since Saturn was going to get a space puppy, that meant that Ms. Star couldn't do it too! \"Try asking Mars.\" said Saturn. \"He might know what to get Moon.\" Ms. Star asked Mars. \"Well,\" said Mars. \"I know that I'm getting Moon a space ship, and that Neptune, Uranus and Pluto are going together to get Moon a new house.\" \"Wow!\" said Ms. Star. \"How am I ever going to get Moon something as nice as a house, or a space ship, or a space puppy?\" Mars thought about it for a little bit. \"Hmm.\" he said. \"Maybe you could make him something?\" \"What a great idea!\" said Ms. Star. \"I know what would be perfect to make for him!\" That night, at Moon's birthday party, when Moon opened the gift from Ms. Star, he was the happiest he had been about any of the gifts. \"It's the perfect gift! Thank you so much Ms. Star!\" He pulled out of the box a beautiful sweater that Ms. Star had made out of her own star dust. \"It's so cold here in space! A sweater is the best gift ever!\"", "question": "What was the sweater made out of?", "answer": "star dust", "source": "mctest"}
