Remembering and cherishing the memories of our loved ones is so important. It's comforting to know that their influence still guides us. Last Friday, my partner and I talked about how our loved ones have influenced us and what their values meant to us. It was an emotional chat, but it made us feel closer and showed us what really matters. \nDeborah: Those types of conversations really help build relationships. Can you tell me more about the values they have given you?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nDeborah cherishes memories of her loved ones and values discussing relationships.<|eot_id|><|end_of_text|>"}

Now I'm lucky enough to do this as a job, to take something broken and make it into something awesome.\nCalvin: Wow, Dave, that's amazing. Bringing broken things back to life is so satisfying.
